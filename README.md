# Python-Sample-App-Part-Two
Part Two of the Python Sample App for DTS L7 CETM65: Software Engineering Principles

Here we have extracted out some classes into their
own modules and then imported into a ***main module***
which generates the menu and determines user actions.

We have used ***class attributes*** to store the vehicles. These would be replaced with database later.

Instructions:

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Run code with:
    ``` python main.py ```
